= Groovy Spock Workshop

There is 3 parts of the exercises

* Part 1: Solving Groovy and Spock exercises
* Part 2: Solving exercises with collections and closures
* Part 3: Exercises with metaprogramming

In each of the folders the README file should get you started

You can go to the folder for each exercise, and run

 ./gradlew check

To generate a test report. This will give you a hint where to start - some test is failing. Once that is done another one will be next :)

== Hints / Cheating / Solution

You can checkout the solution branch to see one way to solve the exercises.
